<h1>Using the Board Editor</h1>
<p>This website mimics a physical chess board. As such, it is simple and intuitive to use.
 There are two parts: the board itself, and the replacement table.</p>
<h2>Chessboard</h2>
<p>The chessboard is the grid of 64 red and white squares with pieces in the middle of the 
screen. To select a piece, click on its square. To move it, simply click on another 
square on the board. The piece will be moved to that square. If there is another piece
 on the square, that piece will be replaced.</p>
<h2>Replacement Table</h2>
<p>The replacement table is located beneath the chess board. Like on the board, click on
 a piece to select it. When you click on a square on the board, the piece will be replicated
  there (unlike on the chessboard, the original piece on the replacement table is 
   not removed. To remove pieces from the chessboard, first click on the red X on 
   the replacement table, then click on the piece.</p>
